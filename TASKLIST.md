# Tasks

Ordered by priority, highest at the top. Finished tasks move to bottom

## HTML
 - [ ] add input boxes for typing new answers and questions
 - [ ] add Ask New button
 - [ ] add Follow and Answer button
 - [ ] add Sort By button and box of options
 - [ ] test what happens with a really long question...
 - [ ] add viewcount
 - [ ] teacher outline
 - [x] style answers
 - [x] add pictures! :)

## Javascript
 - [ ] load questions and answers ordered
 - [ ] sort by
 - [ ] fix search so it isn&rsquo;t one keystroke behind
 - [ ] viewcount
 - [x] search
 - [x] fix arrow click so that it changes the vote count

## From critique
 - [ ] transitions instead of jump loading of new answers? this is easy in
       JQuery and probably not nearly worth our time without it
 - [x] needs more color/green in bottom area
 - [x] number of answers and &ldquo;answers&rdquo; are too close together
 - [x] leaf could be bigger or something
 - [x] align search bar
