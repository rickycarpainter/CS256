# Tasks

Ordered by priority, highest at the top. Finished tasks move to bottom

## HTML
 - [ ] add Follow button
 - [ ] add Sort By button and box of options
 - [ ] test what happens with a really long question...
 - [ ] add viewcount
 - [ ] teacher outline
 - [x] style answers

 - [x] style buttons in question input box (look at Ricky's last mockup)
 - [x] icons in first few buttons of question input box (look at Ricky's last mockup)
 - [x] add Answer button
 - [x] add Ask New button

## Javascript
 - [ ] sort by
 - [ ] viewcount
 - [x] search
 - [x] fix arrow click so that it changes the vote count
 - [x] fix search so it isn&rsquo;t one keystroke behind
 - [x] hide ask new question box (display: none;) and show on click Ask New
 - [x] load questions and answers ordered

## From critique
 - [ ] transitions instead of jump loading of new answers? this is easy in
       JQuery and probably not nearly worth our time without it
 - [x] needs more color/green in bottom area
 - [x] number of answers and "answers" are too close together
 - [x] leaf could be bigger or something
 - [x] align search bar
